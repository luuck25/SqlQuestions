1.Array can contain primitives (int, char, etc.) as well as object (or non-primitive) references of a class depending on the definition of the array. 

2.In case of primitive data types, the actual values are stored in contiguous memory locations.This makes it easy for the user to find the locations of its elements. 

3. In case of objects of a class, the actual objects are stored in heap segment. (memory location stores only object reference)

4. every element in the array occupies the same amount of space in memory.For example, when we created our int array,

every item that we put into that array will an integer,and in Java, an integer is four bytes,
so every value in our int array was occupying four bytes in memory.You can't have an array element that occupies four bytes
and then the second array element occupies 12 bytes and the third array element occupies 300 bytes.That doesn't work.

5. So, because of that, we can easily calculate the memory address of an array element based on its index.
So, if an array starts at memory address x and the size of each element in the array is y,
then we can calculate the memory address of the ith element,so array i, by using the following expression,
x plus i times y.


Advantages of Arrays in Java
---------------------------------

Java arrays enable you to access any element randomly with the help of indexes

It is easy to store and manipulate large data sets 

Disadvantages of Arrays in Java
------------------------------

The size of the array cannot be increased or decreased once it is declaredâ€”arrays have a fixed size
Java cannot store heterogeneous data. It can only store a single type of primitives
