LinkedList is a linear data structure. However LinkedList elements are not stored in contiguous locations like arrays, they are linked with each other using pointers. Each element of the LinkedList has the reference(address/pointer) to the next element of the LinkedList.

1. Head of the LinkedList only contains the Address of the First element of the List.
2. The Last element of the LinkedList contains null in the pointer part of the node because it is the end of the List so it doesnâ€™t point to anything as shown in the above diagram.
3. The diagram which is shown above represents a singly linked list. There is another complex type variation of LinkedList which is called doubly linked list, node of a doubly linked list contains three parts: 1) Pointer to the previous node of the linked list 2) content of the element 3) pointer to the next node of the linked list.
